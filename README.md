# Building-Material-Database-ECBC-ENS

"""Welcome to the Building's Material Thermal Properties Explorer. This tool provides a comprehensive database of materials available in the Energy Conservation Building Code (ECBC) 2017 and Eco Niwas Samhita 2018 (ENS) documents. It is designed to assist engineers and architects in quickly finding material properties such as Density (kg/m³), Conductivity (k, W/(m·K)), Resistance (R, (m²·K)/W), and Specific Heat (kJ/(kg·K)).

By leveraging this tool, you can streamline your material selection process, optimize your designs, and make more informed decisions. Simply select the desired material from the dropdown menu to view its properties. Enjoy exploring!
